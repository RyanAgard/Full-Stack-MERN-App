Once the highlight of the year, drawing companies, executives, media, and consumers from around the world, its demise seems almost assured. But what effect does that have on the industry as a whole? And where immersive gaming is concerned, does VR need events like E3 anymore?",

        paragraph: "After The Fall made a gory splash when it debuted on PC and the Meta Quest in 2021. The closest thing VR had seen to Left 4 Dead, this co-op zombie shooter put players in control of a survivor tasked with clearing the frozen, post-apocalyptic streets of Los Angeles of Snowbreeds, icy ghouls created by a designer drug mishap that lurk around every corner, hungry for flesh. While a bit too linear and lean in enemy variety, it was a ton of fun to roll in with a squad of up to four players and loot and shoot your way through its icy urban environments, making for one of my most-played VR games of the year.",

The added content and subtle gameplay adjustments are also appreciated and help make the experience & presentation feel of consistent quality. Still, its not much different from what you may have already played on the Wii, so I'd really only recommend it to die hard Kirby fans and those who have played very little or none of the original Wii release. More casual Kirby players that own or have beaten the original game on the Wii may not find enough here to justify the purchase.",

For those on PS5, Series X and PC, this is a welcome surprise - it's not since Scholars of the First Sin for Dark Souls 2 have we seen such a post-launch revamp of a Souls game's aesthetic.",
